Share Entanglements.
Entangled states are symmetric so there is no source and destination.
Therefore, there is no such thing as ingress traffic and egress traffic as in the current Internet.
However, there is such a thing as an initiator and a responder in a server-client type application.
This is because when one node starts communication, it needs to send a connection setup request to another node.
The node which sends the connection setup request is called the initiator, and the node which receives the request is called the responder.
